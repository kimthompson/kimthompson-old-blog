I've grown to love it, and in case anyone's interested I thought I'd share. I'm sure it's not the best or most efficient though. I know tons of other people swear by the terminal in Vim and are put off by the idea of having separate Vim and Tmux navigation commands, but I like the separation of duties.

Gatekeeping because of the tools you use is stupid though, and I have zero patience for it.
