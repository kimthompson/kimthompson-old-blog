So I rebootstrapped this site with CRA and migrated all the components, cleaning up and generalizing as I went.\n I then created our state legislature Balance of Power charts and, as the Leaflet plugin started to fail us, ported all of our election maps over to D3.js.",

I only had a couple of days of patience for that in me and asked if I could recreate the project thus far in Next.js as a proof-of-concept.
